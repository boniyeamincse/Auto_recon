# Boni Recon - Feature and Future Development

## Current Features

### 1. Network Discovery
- **Input IP Block**: Users can input an IP block for scanning.
- **Nmap Scan**: Uses Nmap to perform a ping scan (`-sP`) on the provided IP block.
- **Result Organization**: 
  - Creates a directory for the results with a timestamp.
  - Saves the discovered IP addresses in a structured manner, organized by the first three octets.
- **Output**: Generates a `IPS_list.txt` file containing all discovered IPs and block-wise folders with respective IP lists.

### 2. Dependency Installation
- **Automatic Dependency Check**: Checks if Nmap is installed.
- **Automatic Installation**: Installs Nmap if it's not already installed.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- **Banner Display**: Displays a banner with the title "Boni Recon" and a brief description.
- **Interactive Input**: Prompts the user to enter the IP block.
- **Completion Message**: Notifies the user when the scan is completed and where the results are saved.

## Future Development

### 1. Enhanced Scanning Options
- **Service Detection**: Add an option to perform service detection (`-sV`) on discovered hosts.
- **OS Detection**: Add an option to perform OS detection (`-O`) on discovered hosts.
- **Subnet Scanning**: Allow users to input multiple subnets for scanning in a single run.

### 2. Reporting and Visualization
- **HTML Report**: Generate an HTML report with the scan results for easy viewing.
- **Graphs and Charts**: Integrate with graphing libraries to visualize the scan results (e.g., number of hosts per subnet, service distribution).

### 3. Integration with Other Tools
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Integrate with vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS to perform vulnerability assessments on discovered hosts.
- **Notification Systems**: Add support for sending scan results to email or messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

### 4. Advanced Configuration
- **Configuration File**: Allow users to specify scan settings and options in a configuration file.
- **Custom Scripts**: Enable users to run custom scripts on discovered hosts based on the scan results.

### 5. Performance Improvements
- **Parallel Scanning**: Implement parallel scanning to speed up the discovery process.
- **Resource Management**: Optimize resource usage to handle large-scale scans more efficiently.

### 6. Security Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Add support for authenticated scans where credentials are required.
- **Encrypted Storage**: Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., scan results) is stored securely.

### 7. User Experience
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive web dashboard for managing scans and viewing results.
- **Command-Line Options**: Provide more command-line options for advanced users to customize scans.

### 8. Documentation and Support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for all features and usage instructions.
- **Community Support**: Establish a community forum or support channel for users to ask questions and share ideas.

## Conclusion
The "Boni Recon" project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for network discovery and reconnaissance. With the planned future developments, it will become even more powerful and versatile, catering to a wide range of user needs and use cases.
